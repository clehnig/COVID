SEIAR Group Transmission Model

This is a Susceptible, Exposed, Symptomatic Infectious, Asymptomatic Infectious, Recovered transmission model. Population of size N is divided into G groups with sum(Gs) = N in order to simulate different testing protocols/schedules. 

If a population not under mandadated testing but has impact, a population effect can be added.
